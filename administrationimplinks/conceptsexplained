Q1.How can I configure a service to run at startup?????

    You can run your script on boot process in Ubuntu by adding it to /etc/init.d/rc.local file. Look the steps below.

    Open /etc/rc.local file with this command:

  a.  vim /etc/rc.local

  b.  Add your script that you want to run on boot process there, for example:

  c.  sh /home/ivan/iptables.sh echo 'Iptable Configured!'

  d   Review the comments included in that file and make sure a exit 0 is at the end.

  e.  Save the files. And your script will run on boot process.

Q2.startx  gui for ubuntu?


  a.  Run sudo service lightdm start . This will launch lightdm and let me get into the full Ubuntu desktop. Disadvantage: I have to log in again, and there's no easy way to get rid of it without returning to the console (CTRL-ALT-1) and stopping the service. (or rebooting).
  
  b.  Run xinit . This puts up a minimal GUI with an xterm window, but from within that window I can run gnome-session, which seems to trigger the launch of the full Ubuntu desktop. Disadvantage: the xterm window has to remain running (gnome-session can't be put in the background). Quitting the GUI is a matter of using "Log Out" or hitting Ctrl-C in the xterm window (stopping gnome-session), then exiting the xterm window to quit the X session.
